        question: 'How many points will I get when I complete a skill badge?',
        answer: 'After you complete 2 skill badges you are eligible to earn 1 Arcade point. For every 6 skills badges you will get 3 Arcade points and so on...'

    {
        question: 'I have earned only 1 skill badge. How many points will I get?',

    },
    {
        question: 'Where do I get credits to complete the skill badges?',

        question: 'Why can\'t I take all the labs from Trivia quest in one go?',
        answer: 'Every trivia course lasts 4 weeks. You\'ll get hands-on experience of various technologies through self-paced labs and afterwards you can test your knowledge with a set of questions from the quiz lab but each quiz will be active for a week in successive manner.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Will I receive any swags or physical certificates for the games?',
        answer: 'Users will get a special badge for each game they complete in this event and for each badge earned user will also receive 1 Arcade point which in turn will be used to redeem goodies when the prize counter opens. Please note there won’t be any physical certificates or goodies just for completing the game.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Are there prizes? What are the prizes?',
        answer: 'Yes! The more badges you earn, the more arcade points you accumulate. Redeem points for prizes at the prize counter. The prize counter will be open at specific times throughout the year.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Do I get a prize as soon as I earn a badge?',

    },
    {
        question: 'When does the prize counter open?',
        answer: 'Great question. The prize counter dates would be announced soon. Stay tuned for exact dates.'

        answer: 'One point per eligible game/trivia badge. All eligible game/trivia badges are listed on this page. If it\'s not listed here, it\'s not eligible. Points expire after 6 months. You\'ll have at least one opportunity to redeem points, so please use it, don\'t lose it!'
    },
    {
        question: 'How do I know how many arcade points I have?',
        answer: 'Compare the list of eligible arcade games to your Google Cloud Skills Boost profile to calculate points.'
    },

    },
    {
        question: 'What is the cost? Do I need quarters?',
        answer: 'There is no cost to participate in Arcade games. No quarters needed! (Or any other currency!)'
    },

        answer: 'Yes! Please keep in mind that different programs have varying requirements so check with other programs as well.'

        question: 'Can I participate if I\'m located in [your country of residence, whatever that may be]?',
        answer: 'Yes, you may participate within the Google Cloud Skills Boost Terms of Service!'
    },
    {
        question: 'What about sending prizes to [your country of residence, whatever that may be]?',
        answer: 'We make every effort to reach you wherever you are, whenever possible. Items cannot be shipped to countries on the list of US Treasury Department’s Sanctions Programs and the following countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Crimea, Cuba, Sevastopol city and Syria. Each challenge includes details about prizes and shipping availability, as this list may change at any time (locations may be added or removed based on unforeseen events). If you’re in one of these countries, you are welcome to participate within the Terms of Service. You may decline a prize, select an address in a country where shipping is available, or consider charitable options instead.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What if a lab isn\'t working?',
        answer: 'Great question. The community is a great place to get questions answered. Or, you can request assistance from our support team directly within the Skills Boost platform.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What if there are no more seats in a game?',
        answer: 'That happens sometimes! Seats are available on a first come, first serve basis. Sometimes additional seats open up, so keep an eye out for more opportunities to join if you miss the first round.'
    },
    {
        question: 'I\'ve never used Skills Boost before. Help!',
        answer: 'Welcome, I\'m so glad you\'re here. This tour of Google Cloud and the Skills Boost platform will help you get oriented. It\'s available at no cost.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Can I share or gift my Arcade points with someone else?',
        answer: 'No. Because points are based on your learning record, they stick with you. But if you\'re interested in giving, please do check out charitable options when the prize counter opens.'
